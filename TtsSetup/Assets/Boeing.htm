 <div>  <h3> Background  </h3>  <p> In 1970, Boeing's 747 became the first wide-body jetliner to enter service.[3] The 747 was the first passenger jet that was wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin.[4] Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow-body jets.[5][6] The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies.[5] To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies.[7] This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation.[7] The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and landing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner.[5] At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a T-tail.[3] </p>  <div>  <div>  <div>  The 7X7 would make its Farnborough Airshow debut in 1982 as the 767-200.  </div>  </div>  </div>  <p> By 1976, a twinjet layout, similar to the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the baseline configuration.[8] The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants.[8] While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous,[8] the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets.[3] As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities.[9] Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7.[5][10] Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757.[10] Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.[11][12] </p>  <p> In January 1978, Boeing announced a major extension of its Everett factory—which was then dedicated to the manufacture of the 747—to accommodate its new wide-body family.[13] In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation,[14] and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a trijet 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes.[8][15] The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes.[16] The 767 was officially launched on July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines later that year.[16] The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity was too close to the 757's seating,[16] while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration.[8] </p>  <h3> Design effort  </h3>  <p> In the late 1970s, operating cost replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases.[6] As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset.[5] Boeing targeted a 20 to 30 percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology.[6] As development progressed, engineers used computer aided design for over one-third of the 767's design drawings,[6] and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests.[16] Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost.[10][12] Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics.[17] Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4 billion.[6] </p>  <div>  <div>  <div>  Forward view of a Continental Airlines 767-400ER, showing fuselage profile, wing dihedral, and CF6 engines  </div>  </div>  </div>  <p> Early 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt & Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans, marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner.[18] Both jet engine models had a maximum output of 48,000 pounds-force (210 kN) of thrust.[9] The engines were mounted approximately one-third the length of the wing from the fuselage, similar to previous wide-body trijets.[6] The larger wings were designed using an aft-loaded shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed lift more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer's previous aircraft.[6][19] The wings provided higher-altitude cruise performance, added fuel capacity, and expansion room for future stretched variants.[16] The initial 767-200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic,[20] and would be capable of operating routes up to 3,850 nautical miles (7,130 km).[21] </p>  <p> The 767's fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at 16.5 feet (5.03 m).[5] While it was narrower than previous wide-body designs, seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted, and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag.[9][18] However, the fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide-body unit load devices side-by-side.[22][23] As a result, a smaller container, the LD2,[24] was created specifically for the 767.[25] The adoption of a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section,[18] providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft.[6][18] </p>  <div>  <div>  <div>  The original two-crew 767 glass cockpit  </div>  </div>  </div>  <p> The 767 was the first Boeing wide-body to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit.[17]Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly.[17] Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft.[26] The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a U.S. presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets.[26][27] A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models.[28]Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured.[28][29] The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course,[19] and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types.[30] </p>  <h3> Production and testing  </h3>  <p> To produce the 767, Boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC.[7] The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage.[6] The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail).[7] Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory.[6] For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners.[6] This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747.[6] Final assembly of the first aircraft began on July 6, 1979.[3] </p>  <div>  <div>  <div>  Final assembly of a 767-300F at Boeing's Everett factory, which was expanded for 767 production in 1978  </div>  </div>  </div>  <p> The prototype aircraft, registered N767BA and equipped with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981.[31] By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA).[6] On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight under the command of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit.[32] The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the landing gear owing to a hydraulic fluid leak.[32] The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.[33] </p>  <p> The 10-month 767 flight test program utilized the first six aircraft built.[3][33] The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines.[9][34] The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance,[34] while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights.[35] During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets.[35] Following the successful completion of 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in July 1982.[32][33] The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines.[32] The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.[9] </p>  <h3> Service entry and operations  </h3>  <p> The 767 entered service with United Airlines on September 8, 1982.[36] The aircraft's first commercial flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route.[36] The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service three months later with Delta Air Lines.[3] Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including U.S. transcontinental services.[37] American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983.[38] The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners.[39] In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1 percent rate of takeoff without delay due to technical issues, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft.[39] Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance.[39] Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation slide latch, and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.[39] </p>  <div>  <div>  <div> TWA began operating the first 767-200 ETOPS flights in May 1985.  </div>  </div>  </div>  <p> Seeking to capitalize on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, in its first year of service.[40]Ethiopian Airlines placed the first order for the type in December 1982.[40][41] Featuring increased gross weight specifications and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier payloads at distances up to 6,385 nautical miles (11,825 km),[42] and was targeted at overseas customers.[9] The 767-200ER entered service with El Al on March 27, 1984.[41] The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.[9] </p>  <p> In the mid-1980s, the 767 spearheaded the growth of twinjet flights across the northern Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines.[40] Before the 767, over-water flight paths of twinjets could be no more than 90 minutes away from diversion airports.[43] In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria.[43] This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land.[43] The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines.[43] The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration,[37] and all available engines received approval by 1993.[44] Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.[40][45] </p>  <h3> Stretched derivatives  </h3>  <p> Forecasting airline interest in larger-capacity models, Boeing announced the stretched 767-300 in 1983 and the extended-range 767-300ER in 1984.[40][46] Both models offered a 20 percent passenger capacity increase,[24] while the extended-range version was capable of operating flights up to 5,990 nautical miles (11,090 km).[47]Japan Airlines placed the first order for the 767-300 in September 1983.[40] Following its first flight on January 30, 1986,[46] the type entered service with Japan Airlines on October 20, 1986.[41] The 767-300ER completed its first flight on December 9, 1986,[41] but it was not until March 1987 that the first firm order, from American Airlines, was placed.[46] The type entered service with American Airlines on March 3, 1988.[41] The 767-300 and 767-300ER gained popularity after entering service, and came to account for approximately two-thirds of all 767s sold.[40] </p>  <div>  <div>  <div>  A JAL 767-300 lands in front of an ANA 767-300ER at Kansai Airport. The −300 and −300ER variants account for almost two-thirds of all 767s sold.  </div>  </div>  </div>  <p> After the debut of the first stretched 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for even more capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the "Hunchback of Mukilteo" (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage.[48][49] In 1986, the manufacturer announced the 767-X, a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin, but received little interest.[49] By 1988, the 767-X had evolved into an all-new twinjet, which revived the 777 designation.[49] Until the 777's 1995 debut, the 767-300 and 767-300ER remained Boeing's second-largest wide-bodies behind the 747.[46] </p>  <p> Buoyed by a recovering global economy and ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s, with 1989 being the most prolific year with 132 firm orders.[40][45] By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession.[40] During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.[50] By the end of the decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined.[51] The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes.[20][52] Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights.[20] The increase in the number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional hub-and-spoke model.[20][52] </p>  <p> In February 1990, the first 767 equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofans, a 767-300, was delivered to British Airways.[1][53] Six months later, the carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in the engine pylons of several aircraft.[54] The cracks were related to the extra weight of the RB211 engines, which are 2,205 pounds (1,000 kg) heavier than other 767 engines.[54] During the grounding, interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components, and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks.[54] Boeing also performed a structural reassessment, resulting in production changes and modifications to the engine pylons of all 767s in service.[55] </p>  <div>  <div>  <div>  The Boeing 767-400ER was publicly unveiled on August 26, 1999. [41]  </div>  </div>  </div>  <p> In January 1993, following an order from UPS Airlines,[56] Boeing launched a freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995.[41] The 767-300F featured a main deck cargo hold, upgraded landing gear, and strengthened wing structure.[57] In November 1993, the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the E-767, an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) variant based on the 767-200ER.[58] The first two E-767s, featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance radar and other monitoring equipment, were delivered in 1998 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[59][60] </p>  <p> In November 1995, after abandoning development of a smaller version of the 777, Boeing announced that it was revisiting studies for a larger 767.[61][62] The proposed 767-400X, a second stretch of the aircraft, offered an over 12 percent capacity increase versus the 767-300,[24] and featured an upgraded flight deck, enhanced interior, and wider wingspan.[61] The variant was specifically aimed at Delta Air Lines' pending replacement of its aging Lockheed L-1011 TriStars, and faced competition from the A330-200, a shortened derivative of the Airbus A330.[61] In March 1997, Delta Air Lines launched the 767-400ER when it ordered the type to replace its L-1011 fleet.[41][61] In October 1997, Continental Airlines also ordered the 767-400ER to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fleet.[63][64] The type completed its first flight on October 9, 1999, and entered service with Continental Airlines on September 14, 2000.[41] </p>  <h3> Further developments  </h3>  <p> In the early 2000s, cumulative 767 deliveries approached 900, but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn.[65] In 2001, Boeing dropped plans for a longer-range model, the 767-400ERX, in favor of the proposed Sonic Cruiser, a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15 percent faster while having comparable fuel costs as the 767.[66][67] The following year, the manufacturer announced the KC-767 Tanker Transport, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER.[68] Launched with an order in October 2002 from the Italian Air Force, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo.[68] The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003.[68] In May 2003, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging KC-135 tankers.[69][70] The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal,[69] resulting in multiple U.S. government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including Philip Condit, the company's chief executive officer, and chief financial officer Michael Sears.[71] The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[72] </p>  <div>  <div>  <div> Austrian Airlines 767-300ER with blended winglets, which reduce lift-induced drag and improve fuel efficiency  </div>  </div>  </div>  <p> In late 2002, after airlines expressed reservations about its emphasis on speed over cost reduction,[73] Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser.[73] The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20 percent more fuel efficient.[74] The new jetliner was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project.[73] Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history.[74] In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option.[75] Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines.[76] Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays.[77] To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s.[78] The first 787s would ultimately enter service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, three-and-a-half years behind schedule.[79] </p>  <p> In 2007, the 767 received a production boost when UPS and DHL Aviation placed a combined 33 orders for the 767-300F.[80][81] Renewed freighter interest led Boeing to consider enhanced versions of the 767-200 and 767-300F with increased gross weights, 767-400ER wing extensions, and 777 avionics.[82] However, net orders for the 767 declined from 24 in 2008 to just three in 2010.[83] During the same period, operators upgraded aircraft already in service; in 2008, the first 767-300ER retrofitted with blended winglets from Aviation Partners Incorporated debuted with American Airlines.[84] The manufacturer-sanctioned winglets, at 11 feet (3.35 m) in height, improved fuel efficiency by an estimated 6.5 percent.[84] Other carriers including All Nippon Airways and Delta Air Lines also ordered winglet kits.[85][86] </p>  <div>  <div>  <div> UPS, the largest 767-300F operator, placed additional orders in 2007.  </div>  </div>  </div>  <p> On February 2, 2011, the 1,000th 767 rolled out, destined for All Nippon Airways.[87] The aircraft was the 91st 767-300ER ordered by the Japanese carrier, and with its completion the 767 became the second wide-body airliner to reach the thousand-unit milestone after the 747.[87][88] The 1,000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line.[89] Beginning with the 1,001st aircraft, production moved to another area in the Everett factory which occupied nearly half the space as before.[89] The new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost manufacturing efficiency by over 20 percent.[89] </p>  <p> At the inauguration of its new assembly line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013.[89] Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders were forthcoming.[89] On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767,[90] for its KC-X fleet renewal program.[89] The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s.[69] The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.[89] In December 2011, FedEx Express announced a 767-300F order for 27 aircraft to replace its DC-10 freighters, citing the USAF tanker order and Boeing's decision to continue production as contributing factors.[91] FedEx Express announced an agreement to buy an additional 19 of the −300F variant in June 2012.[92][93] Fifteen of these have been added to Boeing's orders and deliveries table as of June 30, 2012.[94] </p>  <div>  </div>  </div>
