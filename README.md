TtsSetup_C_sharp
================

This is the TtsSetup Xamarin C# example to my small article at StackOverflow, comparing Java and 
C# with async/await for Android callbacks implementation. See more at:

Any comments welcome, will try to improve this code. I'm aware of its many flaws, and I'm still
learning Android, Java and C#.
