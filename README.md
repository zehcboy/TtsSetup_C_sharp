TtsSetup_C_sharp
================

This is the TtsSetup Xamarin C# example to my small article at StackOverflow, comparing Java and 
C# with async/await for Android callbacks implementation. See more at:

On June 18, 2013 I also added to this project some test code to benchark the performance of Java vs. Xamarin.Android C#.
More on this testing:

Any comments welcome, will try to improve this code. I'm aware of its many flaws, and I'm still
learning Android, Java and C#.
